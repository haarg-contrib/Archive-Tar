    tests results in case of errors.
  - Small refactorings.

0.27  2018-06-15
  - Added Test::Simple 1.302073 as minimum version required to be able to use
    is_deeply().
  - Getting a logger from Log::Log4perl to be able to improve performance by
    avoiding doing expensive string concatenation unless the log level allows
    it.
  - Reverted changes on list_reset() to go back reading and printing each line
    recovered instead of keeping it in memory, instead of following PBP.
